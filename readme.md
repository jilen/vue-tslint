## Background

Current TSLint can't check .vue file directly. Luckily, there are some solutions.

- If you use Webpack, ts-loader and fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin can help you. In this way, you can keep compiling and linting you ts and vue file in webpack dev mode.

- If you use VSCode, vscode-tslint-vue extension can help you.

- The vue-cli 3 has a [TypeScript plugin](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/tree/dev/packages/@vue/cli-plugin-typescript#readme), it provide the lint command to lint your TypeScript code. But the plugin can't be used alone, this cli tool is created based on the plugin's implementation

- Besides, there is a new linter [Wotan](https://github.com/fimbullinter/wotan) can lint ts code  in .vue file directly.

Thus, before use vue-tslint, make sure you really need it.
